ðŸ“¦ cytocoarsening.py
=======================

We want to identify cell-types that are enriched for both phenotype (e.g. cell phenotype) and relate to the external information. Graph-based approaches for identifying these modules can suffer in the single-cell setting because there is an extremely large number of cells profiled per sample and we often profile multiple samples with multiple different experimental conditions or timepoints.

Parameter Explanation
--------------
The function can be excute at one line.
```
coarsening_group,group_edge,result_dicts=cytocoarsening(cell_data,cell_label,multipass,k_nearest_neighbors)
```
input
* `cell_data` - numpy.ndarray. The single cell data with several features. The shape of ndarray is (cell number,features number)
* `cell_label` - numpy.ndarray. The attribute of each cell data. The shape of ndarray is (cell number,)
* `multipass` - int. The pass number that what want the data size decrease.
* `k_nearest_neighbors` - int. Number of neighbors in the inisial graph in each pass.

output
* `coarsening_group` - dict. The dictionary that indicate supernode as key and the node number list of the group as value in coarsening graph
* `group_edge` - numpy.ndarray. The array that record the edge that combine two nodes
* `result_dicts` - dict. The dictionary that save different result value, including accuracy, error rate, quadratic equation evaluation in feature and label, node number, edge number, runtime, and keypoint 

Toy Example
--------------

```
from cytocoarsening.cytocoarsening import cytocoarsening
import numpy as np
import random

cell_data=[[random.random() for i in range(33)] for j in range(4500)]
cell_data=np.array(cell_data)

cell_label = np.array([0] * 1000 + [1] * (3500))
np.random.shuffle(cell_label)

group,edge,diccts=cytocoarsening(cell_data,cell_label,3,5)
```
