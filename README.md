=======================

We want to identify cell-types that are enriched for both phenotype (e.g. cell phenotype) and relate to the external information. Graph-based approaches for identifying these modules can suffer in the single-cell setting because there is an extremely large number of cells profiled per sample and we often profile multiple samples with multiple different experimental conditions or timepoints.
