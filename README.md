=======================

We want to identify cell-types that are enriched for both phenotype (e.g. cell phenotype) and relate to the external information. Graph-based approaches for identifying these modules can suffer in the single-cell setting because there is an extremely large number of cells profiled per sample and we often profile multiple samples with multiple different experimental conditions or timepoints. Here is [Cytocoarsening github link](https://github.com/ChenCookie/cytocoarsening).

Installation
-----
If you'd like to install by PYPI, please type this line on your command line([Cytocoarsening PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/cytocoarsening/)):

```bash
pip install cytocoarsening
```

* Or you can clone the git repository by, 

```
git clone https://github.com/ChenCookie/cytocoarsening.git
```

* Once you've clone the repository, please change your working directory into this folder.

```
cd cytocoarsening
```

Data access
--------------

-   [preeclampsia](https://zenodo.org/record/6779483#.Yrygu-zMJhF)
-   [covid](https://zenodo.org/record/6780354#.Yryxg-zMJhE)
-   [NK cell](https://zenodo.org/record/6780417#.Yry12-zMJhE)

Take preeclampsia for example, if you'd want to list all of the publicly available files for download,
```
from lxml import html
import requests

r = requests.get(f'https://zenodo.org/record/6779483#.Yrygu-zMJhF')
content = html.fromstring(r.content)
hrefs = content.xpath('//a/@href')
files = [i for i in hrefs if i.endswith('?download=1')]
files = np.unique(files)
print(files)
```
If you'd like to download any  preeclampsia dataset file from zenodo,
```
curl 'https://zenodo.org/record/6779483/files/Han-FCS_file_list.xlsx?download=1' --output Han-FCS_file_list.xlsx
```

Parameter Explanation
--------------
The function can be excute at one line.
```
coarsening_group,group_edge,result_dicts=cytocoarsening(cell_data,cell_label,multipass,k_nearest_neighbors)
```
input
* `cell_data` - numpy.ndarray. The single cell data with several features. The shape of ndarray is (cell number,features number)
* `cell_label` - numpy.ndarray. The attribute of each cell data. The shape of ndarray is (cell number,)
* `multipass` - int. The pass number that what want the data size decrease.
* `k_nearest_neighbors` - int. Number of neighbors in the inisial graph in each pass.

output
* `coarsening_group` - dict. The dictionary that indicate supernode as key and the node number list of the group as value in coarsening graph
* `group_edge` - numpy.ndarray. The array that record the edge that combine two nodes
* `result_dicts` - dict. The dictionary that save different result value, including accuracy, error rate, quadratic equation evaluation in feature and label, node number, edge number, runtime, and keypoint 

Toy Example
--------------

```
from cytocoarsening.cytocoarsening import cytocoarsening
import numpy as np
import random

cell_data=[[random.random() for i in range(33)] for j in range(4500)]
cell_data=np.array(cell_data)

cell_label = np.array([0] * 1000 + [1] * (3500))
np.random.shuffle(cell_label)

group,edge,diccts=cytocoarsening(cell_data,cell_label,3,5)
```
